a Block has a start time and an end time and a lot of coefficients. This is where things get compliocated: we can use the header file to parse the blocks and tell us what comes where. We could instantiate a Header object that contains the location of all bodies in a block. Then we instantiate a body's coefficients by calling the ephFile which knows which block to call by calculating the time in JD. Then the block calls the header to get the exact position inside the block. Then we extract these numbers and return a Coefficients object. Then coefficients know the Chebyshev polynomials so they handle the coefficients and return a postition at a velocity at time, relative to the body in the header.
